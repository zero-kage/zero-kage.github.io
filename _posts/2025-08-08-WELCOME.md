## Welcome!

*There is nothing impossible to him who will try*

I'm not really sure what my motivation is for starting this, I guess I am kind of bored. I want to make this to share my journey
in multiple areas, hacking, cybersecurity, martial arts, general fitness and brain training. I'm a big fan of
Batman and kind of want to embody his ethos and somewhat bring his lifestyle into fruition, minus all of the crime fighting stuff.
I think the goal is to achieve multiple goals in multiple areas, this blog will serve as a log, and a way to hold myself accountable,
as well as just being a general blog, where I post write ups track my progress and a range of other blog-like content.
In my next post I plan on introducing the **Gotham Protocol**, this will go more in-depth on the routine and approach I plan on taking
to achieve ultimate mastery of mind and body - lol this is probably kind of cringe, but I find it fun and it will be interesting
to see where this journey takes me, I'm sure it will be funny and interesting to look back on this in a year or so.
